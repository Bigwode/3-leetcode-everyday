# Matching Networks implementation in Keras
Implementation of [Matching Networks for One Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04080) in Keras

In order to train a 5-way 1-shot model run:
```
python matchingnetwork.py
```
Train a model with Full Context Embedding (FCE) defined as Siamese like pairwise interactions with max pooling:
```
python matchingnetworkwithrelationalembedding.py
```


** Requires Keras version 2.0.0
